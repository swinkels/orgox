This note is used to test that orgox updates "links" to a local subdirectory
whose name is equal to the node date. The word is quoted because it only has to
resemble a link. So something like [[file:20250125/hello.txt]] should be updated to
[[/20250125/hello.txt]] - here, note the extra ~/~ in the file.
