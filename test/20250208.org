This note is used to test how orgox replaces a reference to an (1) existing
note, so an existing file whose filename matches "YYYYMMDD.org", that (2) does
not have a heading, with a link in the Hugo site. For example, suppose a note
contains a reference to this file like this:

    file:../../20250208.org

Then orgox will replace it with this reference:

    file:/posts/2025/01/25/no-title.md

(but only if the original link points to an existing file)
(org-heading-components)
