This note is used to test how orgox replaces a reference to an existing note, so
an existing file whose filename matches "YYYYMMDD.org". It replaces such a link
with a link in the Hugo site. For example, it replaces

    file:../../20250125.org

with

    file:/posts/2025/01/25/1st-heading.md

(but only if the original link points to an existing file)

* 1st heading

** 1st subheading
